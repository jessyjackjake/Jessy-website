            <p>Web development for me is an interesting module, I find it more fun and also kinda frustrating at some point but then I had always had the interest to study it. I started by asking my friends what the module looks like and then they started giving me ideas on what it is all about, then that made me go and start learning the basic stuff of web development. I started by watching youtube videos about HTML, and CSS and also how web pages are been created and also started reading the module activities which gave me more knowledge. My experience so far on the module has been great when it comes to the assessment part, I have learnt a lot of things when it comes to the TCA1, I have so many mistakes and while trying to solve them I realise coding is just step-by-step process and having to know how to use the correct tags in the correct places which I now know how to. Another problem I was facing while doing my TCA1 and also while practising with my webpage was based on the CSS, which is styling my HTML and assigning to the wrong class, this gave me a lot of problems and confusion cause I will get confused and have to start again sometimes which made me upset sometimes but also happy as well because I was learning new things about it.</p>
